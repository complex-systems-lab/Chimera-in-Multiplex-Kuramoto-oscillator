# Chimera state in Multiplex Network

## Model:Kuramoto Oscillators 

Code File: Kuramoto_multiplex.jl
To execute: "julia <filename>.jl
Note the dependencies.

Input: alpha, the phase lag parameter ('α'), taken from the range [0 < α < π]

Output: Time Series of phases of all *N* nodes in [*N* x 1] vector for a particular time-step in the steady state. Note that, in the code, all phase values are wrapped (mod 2π) in the [-π,π] envelop. 

In the following, we write specific values of α for generateing figures of the manuscript:

* **Chimera_State_Snapshot_profile.png** depicting snapshot of *Chimera state* for kuramoto Oscilators for *α = 1.43* (Data File: Chimera_State_Snapshot_profile.txt). Different [*N*x1] vectors i.e. snapshots can be generated by using different initial conditions, by considering states at different time-steps and by changing α values in the neibourhood of the value mentioned above.

* **Chimera_State_Frequency_profile.png** depicting the associated frequency profile of the *Chimera state* for kuramoto Oscilators for *α = 1.43* (Data File: Chimera_State_Frequency_profile.txt)

The considered initial condition is demonstrated in **Generated_Multiplex.png** (Data File: generated_initial.txt)
